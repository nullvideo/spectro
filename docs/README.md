<h1 align='center'>Spectro</h1>

**Spectro™** is a python based application to visualize audio captured from ***AUX** input* by computing [*1D DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform)*][0] on the waveform and decomposing the waveform into several frequency bands (bins).

Spectro can be customized a *lot* by the power of the "configuration files" and the source code that makes it. Currently, this application requires two major dependencies — `SDL2`, `PortAudio`. Without these dependencies the project wouldn't have its soul.

> The `PortAudio` dependency would be removed in future and a plan to release shared libs
> <br/>
> with the program may be conducted.
