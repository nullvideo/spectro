<h1 align='center'>Spectro</h1>

**Spectroâ„¢** is a python based application to visualize audio captured from ***AUX** input* by computing [*1D DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform)*][0] on the waveform and decomposing the waveform into several frequency bands (bins).

The application is not stable and quite broken. All dependencies must be satisfied beforehand otherwise it would not work.
Intent for making is not as a product but as a study material because the code quality is very low.
